Geldium AI-Powered Collections Project
Tata Group – GenAI Data Analytics Virtual Job Simulation (Forage, Feb 2026)

This repository contains all deliverables created as part of Tata iQ’s GenAI-powered Data Analytics job simulation on Forage.
The project focuses on analyzing customer financial behavior, predicting delinquency risk, and designing an AI-driven collections strategy using responsible and explainable AI principles.

🚀 Project Overview

Financial institutions rely heavily on early detection of delinquency to reduce losses and support customers in financial distress.
In this simulation, I worked as a Data Analyst / AI Strategy Associate for Tata iQ’s Financial Services team, completing four structured tasks:

Conducting data exploration using GenAI

Designing a no-code predictive model plan

Presenting insights to stakeholders

Building a high-level AI-powered collections framework

This repository showcases the full workflow, including reports, analysis documents, and the final strategy presentation.

Each task folder contains the analysis, insights, and deliverables for that step.

📊 Task 1 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objectives:

Identify key datasets required to predict delinquency

Analyze data quality, missing values, anomalies, and patterns

Use GenAI tools for summarization, feature understanding, and synthetic data concepts

Key Outcomes:

Highlighted major risk indicators: credit utilization, missed payments, debt-to-income ratio

Identified missing values in income, payment history, and DTI fields

Created a structured EDA report with actionable insights for modeling

🤖 Task 2 — Predictive Model Planning

Objectives:

Use GenAI to scaffold a predictive model for delinquency risk

Select and justify the best modeling approach

Plan evaluation metrics and fairness checks

Key Outcomes:

Chose Logistic Regression as the primary model (high interpretability, regulatory friendly)

Identified the top predictive features

Developed an evaluation framework using AUC, Recall, F1-score, and fairness metrics

Created a model logic document explaining the data → score → decision pipeline

📝 Task 3 — Executive-Facing Business Summary

Objectives:

Create a concise 2-page report for the Head of Collections

Highlight delinquency drivers and customer risk segments

Present a clear, actionable recommendation framework

Discuss ethical and responsible AI considerations

Key Outcomes:

Identified high-utilization and multi-missed-payment customers as highest-risk groups

Proposed a SMART goal for targeted outreach

Outlined fairness risks and mitigation strategies

Created a stakeholder-ready summary report

🧠 Task 4 — AI-Powered Collections Strategy (PPT)

Objectives:

Design a high-level system for autonomous, AI-driven collections

Explain roles for agentic AI vs. human-in-the-loop

Identify fairness, compliance, and explainability guardrails

Present expected business impact

Key Outcomes:

Built a structured PPT outlining how the system works (inputs → decision → actions → learning loop)

Demonstrated how agentic AI optimizes outreach timing and actions

Created clear guardrails for fairness, transparency, and regulatory alignment

Highlighted business KPIs and customer experience improvements

🔧 Skills Demonstrated

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Predictive modeling design & reasoning

GenAI-assisted analytics workflows

Responsible AI & fairness considerations

Business strategy communication

Building stakeholder-ready presentations

Understanding of credit risk and delinquency behavior

Problem structuring & analytical storytelling
