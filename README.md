# Geldium AI-Powered Collections Project
### *Tata Group – GenAI Data Analytics Virtual Job Simulation (Forage, Feb 2026)*

This repository contains all deliverables created as part of Tata iQ’s GenAI-powered Data Analytics job simulation on Forage.  
The project focuses on analyzing customer financial behavior, predicting delinquency risk, and designing an AI-driven collections strategy using responsible and explainable AI principles.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Financial institutions rely heavily on early detection of delinquency to reduce losses and support customers in financial distress.

As a **Data Analyst / AI Strategy Associate**, the simulation included:

- Conducting data exploration using GenAI  
- Designing a no-code predictive model plan  
- Presenting insights to stakeholders  
- Building an AI-powered collections system  

This repository includes all reports, analysis outputs, and the final presentation.

## 📊 Task 1 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### **Objectives**
- Identify useful datasets for delinquency prediction  
- Analyze missing values, anomalies, and data distributions  
- Use GenAI tools for data summarization and feature understanding  

### **Key Outcomes**
- Found major risk indicators:  
  credit utilization, missed payments, debt-to-income ratio  
- Identified missing values in key financial fields  
- Delivered a clean, structured EDA report  

---

## 🤖 Task 2 — Predictive Model Planning

### **Objectives**
- Use GenAI to outline the predictive modeling pipeline  
- Select a suitable model and justify the choice  
- Define evaluation metrics and fairness safeguards  

### **Key Outcomes**
- Selected **Logistic Regression** (interpretable, regulatory friendly)  
- Identified the top predictive features  
- Built evaluation criteria using AUC, Recall, F1-score, fairness metrics  
- Created a model logic flow from **data → score → decision**  

---

## 📝 Task 3 — Executive Business Summary

### **Objectives**
- Create a concise report for the Head of Collections  
- Highlight risk segments and drivers of delinquency  
- Present actionable recommendations  
- Address responsible AI considerations  

### **Key Outcomes**
- Identified high-utilization & multi-missed-payment customers as highest risk  
- Provided SMART recommendations for targeted outreach  
- Highlighted fairness risks and mitigation steps  
- Delivered a stakeholder-ready business summary  

---

## 🧠 Task 4 — AI-Powered Collections Strategy (PPT)

### **Objectives**
- Design a high-level AI-driven collections ecosystem  
- Clarify roles for agentic AI vs. human-in-the-loop  
- Define fairness, compliance, and explainability guardrails  
- Show expected business impact  

### **Key Outcomes**
- Built a complete workflow: **inputs → decisioning → actions → learning loop**  
- Explained how agentic AI selects optimal outreach timing & channels  
- Added fairness and transparency safeguards  
- Demonstrated expected improvements in KPIs and customer experience
